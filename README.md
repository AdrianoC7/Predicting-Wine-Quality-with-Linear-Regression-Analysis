# Predicting-Wine-Quality-with-Linear-Regression-Analysis

This project utilizes linear regression analysis to predict the quality of Portuguese red wines based on chemical attributes. It includes both simple and multiple linear regression models, revealing significant correlations between wine quality and factors such as alcohol content, pH, sulphates, and more. The findings offer valuable insights for wine producers to optimize production processes and enhance product quality.

Key Features:

Simple and multiple linear regression models implemented using Python and statsmodels library.
Dataset contains approximately 1,600 samples of Portuguese red wine, including quality ratings and chemical attributes.
Interpretation of regression results and insights provided for practical applications in wine production.
Skills Demonstrated:

Data manipulation and analysis with pandas.
Statistical modeling and hypothesis testing using statsmodels.
Interpretation and communication of findings for practical use in the wine industry.
